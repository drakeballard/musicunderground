How will we implement this solution?



	Artists will upload a track with artist name, location, and genre.
	Use SoundClouds api for artist to upload their track.
	a link button that will share to facebook wall or twitter that they voted and to come vote as well
	firebase to store the information

What APIs will be used? (Must use at least 2)



	twitter/facebook/soundcloud
